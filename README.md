# Abalone_age_prediction
Typically, the age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone and counting the number of rings through a microscope.This process is tediuos and time consuming.
In this project I developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the age of an abalone from physical measurements only.
